The centerpiece for Tablescapes: Designs for Dining, which explores three distinct dining moments, is Cooper Hewitt's magnificent surtout de table. On view for the first time in 30 years, this newly conserved masterpiece, designed by Pierre-Philippe Thomire for the stepson of Napoleon Bonaparte, Eugène de Beauharnais, exemplifies how dining at the highest levels of wealth and power in early 19th-century France was a theatrical performance, bringing architecture to the tabletop in an elaborate arrangement of vessels for food."

            "text": `Founded by Stefan Scholten and Carole Baijings, the Dutch design studio Scholten & Baijings has developed an experimental design process that combines traditional craft techniques with industrial design practices to create tableware, furniture, and textiles that are freshly contemporary. As the studio works through new ideas for products, the designers remain open to unexpected discoveries and depend on direct contact with their materials to guide their decision making. "We always mix our own colors, make our own materials, and create our own models," Carole Baijings explains. "Doing this produces forms you couldn't possibly create on a computer. And colors that are precisely right. Only when you hold a model in your hands will you know if it fits human proportions."`

            "text": "The term iridescence derives from Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, and refers to a vibrant optical effect of rainbow-like colors that change in the light. Found on pearls, bird feathers, and insect wings, iridescence draws from and celebrates the natural world’s multidimensional colors and organic forms. Since the Middle Ages, designers have experimented with ways to achieve an iridescent effect on the surface of glass and ceramics and incorporate naturally iridescent materials such as mother of pearl into their jewelry and metalwork. Featuring objects from the museum’s collection, this exhibition demonstrates how iridescence has maintained a lasting impact on design. "

            "text": "Richard Landis is a weaver but his visual language is that of an abstract painter. His intricate designs and subtle color blending are built on the intrinsic grid of weaving’s warp and weft, using the vertical and horizontal interaction of threads on the loom, to create patterns that offer endless variety—reiteration without repetition.   A masterful colorist, Landis calculates every possible full and half tone within a defined set of colors, weaving with fine sewing thread to ensure subtle color blending. In his preferred weave structure—double cloth—is two parallel planes of fabric are woven simultaneously,  which enables multicolored complex patterning with a relatively simple hand loom. The works in this gallery reveal the evolution of the designer’s thinking about complex color and pattern interaction over the span of his career. While the actual weaving could be completed in days, it sometimes took Landis a month or more to design the pattern and prepare the loom."
